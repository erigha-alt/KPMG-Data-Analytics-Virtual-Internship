# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship

INTRODUCTION
   Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. 
	 Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. The project is mainly divided into three tasks:

 
TASK 1: DATA QUALITY ACCESSMENT:

   The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
   Customer Demographic
   Customer Addresses
   Transactions data in the past 3 months
   We performed the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

TASK 2: DATA INSIGHT:

   targeting high value customers based on customers demographic and attribute:
	 In building this recommendation, we started with a PowerPoint presentation which outlined the approach which we will be taking.
   The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.
   Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.

TASK 3: PRESENTATION:

   Developed a dashboard using POWER BI  that displays the data summary and results of the analysis. Some of the focussed business context when presenting findings were:

   What are the trends in the underlying data?
   Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
   What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?
   What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
